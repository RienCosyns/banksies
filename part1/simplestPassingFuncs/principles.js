// In today's exercises, simplest passing functions will seem a little silly.  
// This is to be expected.  
// Today we are exploring the concept in isolation so next week we can incorporate it into the project.


// The concept of a simplest passing function will become very important next week.
// Next week's project is a multi-file javascript app to run in your browser.
// The first step in developing the project will be to create a dummy project.
// Your dummy project will consist of all the objects required by the prompt,
//	 only every method will return hard-coded values.
// The purpose of this is for you to make sure your program's structure is correct 
// 	 before you spend loads of time trying to code the tricky bits.

// Unit Tests
// Testing and it's role in development is a whole nother discussion.
// We will be looking at Test Driven Development in week 6.
// This series of exercises is simply an introduction to what tests are.
