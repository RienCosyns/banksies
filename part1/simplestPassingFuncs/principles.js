// Simplest passing functions will become very important next week when we begin developing multi-object apps.

// The first step in developing the project will be to create a dummy project.
// Your dummy project will consist of all the objects required by the prompt,
//	 Every method will return hard-coded values.
// The purpose of this is for you to make sure the whole project 'fits together' 
// 	 before you spend loads of time trying to code the tricky logic bits.

// Unit Test
// A unit test is the fundamental component of any testing strategy.
// this week we will discuss how to write basic ones
// and how to use them to help you, rather than annoy you

// Testing and it's role in larger-scale development is a whole nother discussion.
// We will be looking at Test Driven Development in week 6.
// This series of exercises is simply an introduction to what tests are.
